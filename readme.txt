This is a project used to analzye data from a weather dataset. This project is for fun and practice in Python. As of now, I am using the GHCN-Daily dataset, which is a merged set of climate records coming from many different locations. Data is archived daily, which I will use to interpret in my Python program. The link to the index of the dataset as well as related citations are listed below:

Journal articale describing GHCN-Daily:

Menne, M.J., I. Durre, R.S. Vose, B.E. Gleaseon, and T.G Houston, 2012: An overview of the Global Historical Climatology Newtork-Daily Database. Journal of Atmsopheric and Oceanic Technology, 29, 897-910, doi:10.1175/JTECH-D-11-00103.1.

Specific version of the dataset as of 2 March 2018:

The current point of this project is for a user to easily be able to sift through this database in order to find information on weather for specific dates and locations.

This project is an opportunity for me to learn more about how to handle large amounts of information, specifically using pandas to analyze csv files.
